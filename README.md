## Description
A website for renting out a mobile home. With a calendar to show the availability of the mobile home and a contact form.

## Project status
All of the functionality is implemented, scalability on mobile devices could be improved and the files with redundant code can be cleaned up. The styling can also be improved and page navigation can be improved. The dependencies are old and not corresponding, this could be improved by using newer packages. Could also stick to one styling package.

  1. Clone the repo following this command: ```git clone git@github.com:erikaard/bobil.git```
  2. ``` npm install ``` inside the cloned repo
  3. ``` npm start ``` to run the site locally
